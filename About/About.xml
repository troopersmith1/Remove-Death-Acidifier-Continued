  <description>Fixed and Updated. Original mod can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2016569177
  
Adds an operation to remove death acidifiers from pawns.It's a fairly difficult operation that requires 10 medicine skill.

Death acidifiers don't do much on recruited pawns except make you really worried about all the gear you gave them disappearing if they die.

If you have the time to capture and operate on someone who has one, you also have the time to just strip them of their items.

The inability to remove them basically doesn't impact game balance, but does make pawn management a lot more finicky.

Hence, this mod.</description>
